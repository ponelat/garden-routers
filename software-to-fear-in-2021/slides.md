## Software to fear (and love) in 2021

![height:400px](./time-to-fear.gif)

--- 

# Preamble

Well 2020 wasn't all that fun.

And while innovation didn't stop, fortunately there is nothing _that ground breaking_ as to cause real *panic*.

2021 is going to be fine. I hope.

# Protection of Personal Information (POPI)

- Don't be evil ... with people's personal info.

## TailwindCSS - Why?

Stolen straight from the site...

#### **“Best practices” don’t actually work.**
I’ve written a few thousand words on why traditional “semantic class names” are the reason CSS is hard to maintain, but the truth is you’re never going to believe me until you actually try it.
